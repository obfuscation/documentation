Introduction
====

This repository is a cross-project collaboration space for censorship circumvention tools.
Our initial focus is expanding Tor's [pluggable transports](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/pt-spec.txt) work to easily
work in a wider variety of circumvention tools. Initial collaborators include [Lantern](http://getlantern.org),
[Psiphon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/0ubz-2q11-gi9y/en.html), [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and 
[uProxy](https://www.google.com/ideas/projects/uproxy/).

Collaboration
====

There are two main collaboration spaces:

**Mailing List**: [Our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/traffic-obf)

**IRC Meeting**: The Pluggable Transports community conducts biweekly IRC meetings. You can 
find us in #tor-dev at the OFTC network [every second friday](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dt92shou5q1ooe1kptubhclo4s%40group.calendar.google.com) at 
[16:00 UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=16&min=00&sec=0p1=0).
